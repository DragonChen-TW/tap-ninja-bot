# Implementation Plan: Base Game (Tap Ninja Bot)

This plan provides step-by-step instructions for AI developers to implement the base game. Each step includes a manual or functional validation step to ensure correct implementation. No code or unittests are includedâ€”only clear, actionable instructions.

---

## 1. Set Up Project Structure
- **Instruction:** Create the initial project directory and subfolders for source code, assets, and documentation.

## 2. Initialize Version Control
- **Instruction:** Initialize a Git repository and add a .gitignore file for the chosen language/framework.

## 3. Define Game Loop Skeleton
- **Instruction:** Create a main entry point with a basic game loop that can start, update, and end.
- **Validation:** Run the game; confirm that the loop starts and exits cleanly with log messages for each phase.

## 4. Implement Input Handling
- **Instruction:** Add logic to detect and process user input (e.g., tap or click events).

## 5. Display Basic Game UI
- **Instruction:** Create a minimal UI showing the main game area and a score display.

## 6. Add Tap Detection Logic
- **Instruction:** Implement logic to detect valid taps/clicks within the game area and increment the score.

## 7. Implement Score Tracking
- **Instruction:** Store and update the player's score during gameplay.

## 8. Add Game Over Condition
- **Instruction:** Define a simple game over condition (e.g., timer runs out or a set number of taps).
- **Validation:** Play until the condition is met; verify the game ends and displays a game over message.

## 9. Implement Restart Mechanism
- **Instruction:** Allow the player to restart the game from the game over screen.

## 10. Basic Logging and Error Handling
- **Instruction:** Add logging for key events and implement basic error handling for user actions.

*Note: No unittests are required for this implementation plan. Only a few key manual validation steps are included.*
